# Tech Stack Used
- Nextjs 14 ,app Router Ssr
- Django DRF Sqlite 
- 


# Backend

- Choose one of the following Python web frameworks: Django or FastAPI.
- Implement a RESTful API for CRUD operations on blog posts, categories, and tags.
- Each blog post should have fields like title, content, author, creation date, category, and tags.
- 1 category has many blogs and 1 blog has many tags and vice versa.
- Implement user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or a similar approach.
- Implement a commenting system for blog posts, where authenticated users can leave comments.

# Frontend

- Use React to build the user interface.
- Implement the following components/pages:
- Home page: Display a list of recent blog posts with pagination or infinite scrolling.
- Post detail page: Display the full content of a blog post, along with comments.
- Create/update post page: Allow authenticated users to create or update blog posts, with options to select categories and tags.
- Category listing page: Display a list of categories with the ability to filter blog posts by category.
- Tag listing page: Display a list of tags with the ability to filter blog posts by tag.
- User authentication pages: Login, registration, and password reset pages.
- Implement client-side form validation for input fields.
- Consume the backend API to perform CRUD operations on blog posts, categories, and tags.

# Bonus (if time permits):

- Write unit tests for backend and frontend components (aim for at least 50% code coverage).
- Implement basic security measures (e.g., input validation, protection against common web vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF).
